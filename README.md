# Limacharle-EDR-SOAR
## Overview
In this project, I set up a Windows Server virtual machine equipped with the LimaCharlie agent to enhance endpoint detection capabilities. The primary objective was to create detection rule to  detect the LaZagne password-cracking tool within the VM environment and tines used to send detections details to security team via email .
